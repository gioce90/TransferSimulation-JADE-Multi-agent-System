## Author's notes
This repository is the result of [my old university thesis](https://www.academia.edu/20176049/ITS_un_approccio_multi_agente_basato_su_JADE_Tesi_di_Laurea_). 

**It hasn't been maintained for years** (and will never will be), it's only here for nostalgia and because other developers asked me to publish the project many years ago.
